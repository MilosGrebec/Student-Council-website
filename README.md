# Student Council website

Student council website (i couldn't think of better name) is made as MERN stack and it was made back in like october or november last year when i joined studect council.

Now in my high school, student council was not that serius but since a bunch of students came one profesor asked if someome can make like an webisite that would run on school server where we can keep track of who is coming on which day and well i made this.

It was not used very much and it has very simple not responsive design, i made it as fast as i could but as i said it was not used very much because shortly after that school stopped working due to political protests and after it started working again there was not time for student council.

Still i gave them files and everything so they could use it in future.
